create-6pp-app

Official CLI for Creating Express Apps with Production-Level Folder Structure

This command-line interface (CLI) streamlines the creation of new Express.js applications with a well-organized folder structure optimized for production environments.

Key Features:

    Production-Ready Structure: Enforces a clear separation of concerns, promoting maintainability and scalability.
    Express.js Integration: Sets up a basic Express application with essential configurations.
    Simplified Project Setup: Saves you time by automating the initial project creation process.

Installation:
Bash

npm install create-6pp-app -g


Usage:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Express project.

    Run the following command:
    Bash

    create-6pp-app <project-name>

    

    Replace <project-name> with the desired name for your application.

Generated Folder Structure:

your-project-name/
├── app/                   # Main application directory
│   ├── controllers/         # Controllers for handling application logic
│   ├── models/              # Data models
│   ├── routes/              # Routing definitions
│   ├── views/               # HTML templates (if using view engine)
│   └── index.js             # Main application entry point
├── public/                # Static assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images)
├── config/                 # Configuration files (e.g., database connection, server settings)
├── .gitignore              # Default Git ignore file
├── package.json             # Project dependencies
├── README.md               # This file (you're reading it!)
└── server.js               # Main server file

Getting Started:

After creating your project, navigate to the project directory:
Bash

cd your-project-name



    Install required dependencies:
    Bash

    npm install

    

Start your development server:
Bash

npm start   # (or yarn start if using yarn)



This will typically start your server on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).

Customization:

    The default port and other configuration options can be adjusted in config/server.js.
    You can further customize the folder structure to fit your specific needs.
